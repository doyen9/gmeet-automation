the lines in hastags are called comments, ive made them to make u understand the codes well, its like instructions. Follow them
in ur command line, type these one by one and hit enter
1. pip install pyautogui
2. pip install webbrowser
3. pip install datetime
4. pip install time

if u get any error while installing these, then type this and hit enter
pip install --upgrade pip

i have added 3 variables, as in time , those are, hr1, mn1, and hr2, and all are in 24 hrs format
       hr1 is ur lunch break time, in hours
       mn1 is ur lunch break time , in minutes
       hr2 is ur class time, in hours
       change them accordingly
in the last 4th line, u need to change the sleep time accordingly, tht shows the total class hours. Plz enter the time in seconds
       
once u run the code,
enter ur link by pasting it using ctrl+v and hit enter
then let the it do the rest of the magic
